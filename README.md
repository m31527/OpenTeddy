# OpenTeddy

**The platform that makes local LLMs ship work.**

Local models alone are weak. Wrap them in OpenTeddy and you get a real agent —
hardened orchestration, a self-growing skills library, and just enough
commercial-LLM escalation to finish what local can't.

## Why this exists

A 2B / 4B / 7B local model on its own is a toy. It hallucinates, it loops,
it stops mid-task. The model isn't the product — **the platform around it
is**. OpenTeddy is that platform:

- A **hardened agent loop** that knows when to give up, when to retry, and
  when to call Claude — no infinite "let me try that again" doom-spirals.
- A **self-growing skills library** that turns repeated work into plain
  Python functions, so the second time you ask the same question it costs
  zero LLM calls.
- **Hardware-tuned model presets** for everything from a 16 GB MacBook to
  a DGX Spark — the right `num_ctx`, `max_tokens`, and timeout per tier.
- **Commercial-LLM escalation as a safety net**, not a bill — Claude only
  gets called when local genuinely can't finish, and the Usage dashboard
  shows you how much GPT-4 would've charged for the same work.

The result: your $0/token local hardware actually finishes the job, and
the savings counter in the sidebar is what makes you stop worrying about
Claude Pro auto-renewing.

## Highlights

- **Local-first** — planning (Gemma) and execution (Qwen) run on your machine via Ollama; Claude is only called when local models struggle.
- **Auto-escalation to Claude** — timeouts, low confidence, repeated failures, hard-failure signals in tool output (e.g. `unhealthy` containers, `ERROR 1045`), or failed health checks all trigger Claude intervention automatically.
- **Self-growing skills** — repeated tasks are promoted into reusable Python skills, cutting LLM calls over time.
- **Streaming UI** — both the orchestrator's planning and the executor's answer stream token-by-token via WebSocket — no more staring at a spinner while the model thinks.
- **Per-step deliverable verification** — LLM-as-judge confirms each produced file actually matches the goal, catching the "wrote a report *about* the game instead of the game" failure mode. Toggleable for big-model setups where extra calls are too costly.
- **Loop hardening for small models** — adaptive prompts, a parallel low-risk tool fan-out, per-tool-name caps, a circuit breaker, discovery memos, and a context watchdog that compresses old turns before busting `num_ctx`.
- **Reconnect-safe streaming** — the WebSocket carries a 600-event ring buffer so a flaky network or a tab refresh replays the missed events instead of leaving the UI stuck.
- **Web dashboard** — submit tasks, watch tool calls stream live, review pending approvals, manage memory, render Markdown/GFM tables, embed Chart.js datalabels in HTML reports, and tune settings.
- **Native macOS desktop client** — Tauri 2.x shell with onboarding wizard (Ollama install + tier-based model pull), language picker, mode-locked sessions, auto-update against GitHub Releases, and one-click diagnostics download. See [`desktop/`](desktop/).
- **Analytic / report mode** — first-class `csv_describe` + `python_exec` tools and an HTML report generator that renders charts with value labels.
- **Human-in-the-loop** — high-risk shell commands (rm, sudo, mv, …) pause for approval before running.
- **Persistent memory** — ChromaDB-backed long-term memory feeds relevant context back into future plans.
- **22-locale i18n** — UI strings live in `static/i18n.js`; build-hash check auto-reloads when the dashboard is updated.
- **Hot-reloadable settings** — change models, thresholds, performance toggles, and endpoints from the UI without restarting the server.

## Loop Hardening (small-model resilience)

The agent loop has been progressively hardened to make small / mid-size local
models (Gemma 3:4B, Qwen 2.5:3B class) reliable enough to ship work end-to-end,
not just fast enough to look impressive on a single tool call:

| Mechanism | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Adaptive prompts** | Compact system prompts on small models; richer guidance only when context allows. |
| **Parallel tool fan-out** | Low-risk tool calls (file reads, shell `ls`, HTTP gets, `csv_describe`) inside a single round are dispatched with `asyncio.gather` instead of serially. |
| **Per-step deliverable verification** | After each successful subtask, an LLM-as-judge reviews the produced HTML/MD/code file. If it looks like a *description of* the goal rather than the actual deliverable (the "Snake Game report" failure pattern), the subtask is forced to retry with feedback. |
| **Context watchdog** | When the prompt size approaches `num_ctx`, the executor compresses earlier turns into a recap and pins discovery memos to the system prompt — keeping recent tool context intact instead of letting Ollama silently truncate. |
| **Discovery memos** | Useful one-off facts learned from tool calls (e.g. "the workspace already contains `data.csv` with columns X/Y/Z") are pinned to the system prompt so the model doesn't re-discover them every round. |
| **Per-tool-name cap** | Each tool name is capped at 5 calls per subtask — stops the model from re-running `csv_describe` on the same file ten times. |
| **Circuit breaker** | After 5 cumulative tool failures the loop is forced to commit to a final answer instead of looping forever. |
| **Common error hints** | Twelve frequent stack-trace patterns (`ModuleNotFoundError`, `KeyError`, `PermissionError`, …) are matched against tool stderr and converted into one-line hints so the model corrects itself instead of repeating the same mistake. |
| **WS reconnect + replay** | The dashboard WebSocket carries a 600-event ring buffer keyed by sequence number — a refreshed tab or a wifi blip replays missed events on reconnect. |

## How Claude Steps In

OpenTeddy tries to keep every task local. Claude is called **only** when the local path breaks down:

| Trigger | Where | Default |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Subtask timeout (local model hangs) | `orchestrator._run_subtask` | 120 s |
| Low self-reported confidence | `executor._qwen_execute` | `< 0.6` |
| Repeated failures in a row | `orchestrator._run_subtask` | 3 |
| Hard-failure signal in tool output (`unhealthy`, `Exited`, `ERROR 1045`, `Error response from daemon`, …) | `executor._finalize_response` | confidence clamped to 0.3 → escalates |
| Container health check fails after a Docker task | `orchestrator._inspect_docker_health` | auto-pulls `docker logs` + `inspect`, then escalates |
| Deliverable verifier returns `FAIL` | `orchestrator._verify_deliverable` | confidence clamped to 0.3 → retry, then escalate |
| Circuit breaker tripped (5 cumulative tool failures) | `executor._qwen_execute` | forces final-answer commit; escalation kicks in if confidence is still low |

This keeps cost low for everyday work while still guaranteeing you get a real answer when the local model cannot deliver one. All triggers can be globally disabled via `ESCALATION_ENABLED=false` (or the per-session "Local-only" toggle in the UI).

## Self-Growth Mechanism

1. When Qwen executes a subtask it suggests a **skill name** if a reusable function would have helped.
2. The Executor calls `SkillFactory.generate_skill()` in the background.
3. Claude writes the skill as an `async def run(input_data: dict) -> str` function and saves it to `skills/<name>.py`.
4. The skill starts in **TESTING** status. After `SKILL_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD` successful invocations it is promoted to **ACTIVE**.
5. Future tasks automatically match and invoke active skills — no LLM call needed.

## Configuration Reference

Most of these can also be edited live from the dashboard's **Settings** panel —
changes are persisted to SQLite and `config.reload_from_store()` re-applies them
without a server restart.

### Core

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Required only if escalation is enabled. Anthropic API key. |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | `claude-opus-4-6` | Claude model for escalation. |
| `GEMMA_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama base URL for the orchestrator. |
| `GEMMA_MODEL` | `gemma3:4b` | Orchestrator model tag. |
| `QWEN_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama base URL for the executor. |
| `QWEN_MODEL` | `qwen2.5:3b` | Executor model tag. |
| `DB_PATH` | `openteddy.db` | SQLite database path. |
| `MEMORY_DB_PATH` | `./memory_db` | ChromaDB directory. |
| `SKILLS_DIR` | `skills` | Directory for skill files. |

### Escalation

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ESCALATION_ENABLED` | `true` | Master kill-switch for Claude. When `false`, low-confidence / timeout / failure-signal triggers stay local and surface a failure to the user instead of calling Claude. |
| `ESCALATION_THRESHOLD` | `0.6` | Min Qwen confidence before escalation. |
| `ESCALATION_FAILURE_LIMIT` | `3` | Max consecutive failures before escalation. |
| `SUBTASK_TIMEOUT` | `120` | Seconds before a subtask is treated as hung. |
| `SKILL_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD` | `5` | Successes needed to promote a skill. |

### Performance toggles (loop hardening)

Most of these matter most on big models — turn them off to trade safety nets for speed.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `STREAMING_ENABLED` | `true` | Stream LLM tokens to the chat as they generate. Major perceived-latency win on small thinking models. |
| `VERIFICATION_ENABLED` | `true` | Run the per-step LLM-as-judge verifier after each successful subtask. Set to `false` on big-model setups (DGX Spark, qwen3.5:35b) where each judge call is 5–60s. |
| `QWEN_NUM_CTX` | `16384` | Ollama `num_ctx` for the executor. Larger = more tool-round history before the watchdog has to compress, but more VRAM. |
| `GEMMA_NUM_CTX` | `16384` | Same, for the orchestrator. |
| `CONTEXT_COMPRESS_AT` | `0.7` | Trigger context compression when prompt-token usage crosses this fraction of `num_ctx`. |

## Desktop Client (macOS)

OpenTeddy ships with a native macOS shell built on **Tauri 2.x** that wraps the
web dashboard inside a polished launcher. Source lives in [`desktop/`](desktop/)
(its own repo — gitignored from the main repo).

What you get on top of the web UI:

- **Onboarding wizard** — language picker, Privacy Policy gate, hardware
  tier-select (Beginner / Advanced / Flagship), one-click Ollama install,
  streaming model-pull progress.
- **Mode-locked sessions** — once a session has its first task, the Chat /
  Analytic / Build mode is locked so the agent's tool palette stays consistent
  for that conversation.
- **Custom dialogs** — replaces native `confirm` / `alert` / `prompt` (which
  Tauri blocks) with in-app modals that match the chrome.
- **Auto-update against GitHub Releases** — periodic poll, in-app changelog,
  one-click apply.
- **Diagnostics download** — single-click `app.log` + tasks/usage/settings
  zip for bug reports.
- **Returning launches skip the splash** — once you've finished onboarding the
  splash goes straight into `enter_main`, so subsequent starts land on the
  main window immediately.

```bash
cd desktop
npm install
npx tauri dev          # hot-reload dev (still needs uvicorn running separately)
./scripts/build_macos.sh             # package: desktop/dist/OpenTeddy-<ver>-<arch>.dmg
./scripts/build_macos.sh --target universal   # universal2 (arm64 + x86_64)
```

The packaged `.dmg` is **unsigned** until an Apple Developer ID is wired up —
first-run users need to right-click → Open, or:
`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OpenTeddy.app`.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **macOS** (Intel / Apple Silicon) | ✅ Fully supported | Primary development target. |
| **Linux** | ✅ Fully supported | Any distro with Python 3.11+ and Ollama. |
| **Windows (native)** | ⚠️ Partial — use WSL2 if possible | See caveats below. |
| **Windows (WSL2)** | ✅ Fully supported | Behaves like Linux. Recommended on Windows. |

### Windows caveats

The codebase itself is cross-platform Python (uses `pathlib`, `os.path.join`,
`asyncio`), and `package_tool.py` already handles the Windows venv layout
(`Scripts\pip.exe`). The things that actually trip Windows users are:

- **The executor LLM generates POSIX shell commands.** When Qwen decides to
  run `ls`, `rm -rf`, `grep`, `chmod`, or pipes like `cmd1 | tee file`, those
  are executed through the system shell — which is **cmd.exe / PowerShell**
  on native Windows, so they fail. Running OpenTeddy under **WSL2** makes
  this a non-issue.
- **`lsof` / `ps` are not available** on native Windows. The deploy-tool
  helpers that inspect port occupancy (`port_probe`, `port_free` in
  [`tools/deploy_tool.py`](tools/deploy_tool.py)) degrade: `port_probe`
  returns a bound/free flag but no PID/process name; `port_free` returns an
  error and cannot kill by port.
- **Ollama on Windows** is officially supported (install from ollama.com) —
  pulling and running Gemma/Qwen works the same as on Mac/Linux.

**Recommendation:** on Windows, install Ollama natively on the host, then
run OpenTeddy itself inside **WSL2 Ubuntu**. That gives you GPU-accelerated
local inference + a POSIX userspace for the shell-heavy parts of the agent.

### Docker network caveat (Linux hosts)

`docker-compose.yml` uses `extra_hosts: ["host-gateway:host-gateway"]` so
the container can reach Ollama running on the host. This requires Docker
Engine **20.10+** on Linux, and Ollama must be bound to `0.0.0.0`, not
just `127.0.0.1` — otherwise the container's bridged traffic can't reach
it. Set `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434` before `ollama serve`. On Docker
Desktop (Mac / Windows) this "just works".

## Docker Deployment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
docker compose up -d
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

Notes:

- Ollama must be running on the host (`ollama serve`).
- The container reaches host Ollama via the `host-gateway` alias set in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Skills and the usage database persist in the `openteddy_data` Docker volume.
- Rebuild image: `docker compose up -d --build`.

### ⚠️ Docker cannot touch your host filesystem

The default `docker-compose.yml` only mounts an isolated named volume
(`openteddy_data` → `/app/data`). It does **not** bind-mount your home
directory, Desktop, Downloads, or any other host folder. That means:

- Tasks like *"read `~/Documents/report.pdf`"*, *"tidy up my Downloads folder"*,
  or *"run this script on my Desktop"* **will not work** in the Docker setup —
  the container simply cannot see those files.
- The agent's shell/file/python tools operate entirely **inside** the
  container. Any files it reads or writes live in `/app/data` and disappear
  if the volume is removed.

**If you need the agent to operate on files on your machine, run OpenTeddy
directly with `uvicorn` (see [Quick Start](#quick-start)) instead of Docker.**
The native process has full access to your filesystem (subject to your user's
permissions), which is what most "local assistant" use cases actually want.

Alternatively, if you really want to stay on Docker, you can add a bind mount
to `docker-compose.yml` — e.g.:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - openteddy_data:/app/data
      - ${HOME}/openteddy-workspace:/workspace   # ← exposed host folder
```

…and then point the agent at `/workspace` inside the container. Only the
folders you explicitly mount are visible; everything else stays isolated.
